<p>Hi everybody</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to share my compilation scripts I made with Maya Python.<br />would be very happy if you could help me improve the codes.<br />named it Alpha version. It is still lacking in terms of UI and UX.<br />Features inside:</p>
<p><br /><strong>1 "Selected Type"</strong> Shortcuts to make selection easier "Maya selection Tools"</p>
<p><br /><strong>2 "Special Settings"</strong> contains various settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>INameAvaible: checks all internal objects to see if the name is used</li>
<li>ClearNameSpace: clears all NameSpace contents</li>
<li>SetShaderType: converts all materials to typed type</li>
<li>LookChange: unlocks or closes the entire selected hierarchy</li>
<li>Delete All UV: finds all UVs in a model, transfers them to "map1" UV and deletes the others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 "Selected Mix Up"</strong> Distributes multiple selected objects according to the entered values.</p>
<p><br /><strong>4 "Walk/Run Plane"</strong> Texture shifting for walking and running cycle animations</p>
<p><br /><strong>5 "Time Slider ShourtKey"</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>6 "Bake Animation"</strong> enters the start end frame bake (as a shortcut)</p>
<p><br /><strong>7 "GC animShake"</strong> adds a shaking animation to the selected object</p>
<p><br /><strong>8 "AnimScale"</strong> bakes the skeletons in the selected root bone in scaled form.</p>
<p><br /><strong>9 "Convert Skeletal Mesh"</strong> Converts all animated polygon objects to skeleton animation (for Unreal and Unity)</p>
<p>In this section, I present it to you as GNU license. I would be happy if you make any additions or changes.</p>
