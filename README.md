Hi everybody

I wanted to share my compilation scripts I made with Maya Python.
I would be very happy if you could help me improve the codes.
I named it Alpha version. It is still lacking in terms of UI and UX.
Features inside:
1 "Selected Type" Shortcuts to make selection easier "Maya selection Tools"
2 "Special Settings" contains various settings:
     INameAvaible: checks all internal objects to see if the name is used
     ClearNameSpace: clears all NameSpace contents
     SetShaderType: converts all materials to typed type
     LookChange: unlocks or closes the entire selected hierarchy
     Delete All UV: finds all UVs in a model, transfers them to "map1" UV and deletes the others.
3 "Selected Mix Up" Distributes multiple selected objects according to the entered values.
4 "Walk/Run Plane" Texture shifting for walking and running cycle animations
5 "Time Slider ShourtKey"
6 "Bake Animation" enters the start end frame bake (as a shortcut)
7 "GC animShake" adds a shaking animation to the selected object
8 "AnimScale" bakes the skeletons in the selected root bone in scaled form.
9 "Convert Skeletal Mesh" Converts all animated polygon objects to skeleton animation (for Unreal and Unity)

In this section, I present it to you as GNU license. I would be happy if you make any additions or changes.
